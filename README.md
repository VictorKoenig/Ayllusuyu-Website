# Ayllusuyu-Website


I wanted to create this outline for the project 
I have been working on and to illustrate the work and explain my progress.

This is a website i have been working on for quite some time, long before attending code louisville.
I picked this project because i have been working with Ayllusuyu on events, workshops, and web work for a long time.
Everything is dependant upon the owners approval. She has very specific ideas and wants it to look a certain way.

I used jquery and bootstrap for a responsive image map that resizes with a interactive menu for the main page.
There is also a jquery image slider throughout. As for the overall responsiveness in mobile the owner of the site liked having 
the whole page show up in mobile rather than an alternate mobile site.

I wanted to find and api that is relavent to the website rather than a distraction so 
I used a mailto api for a donations page for the Peru childrens fund, that can send/recieve data.
There is also a google analytics api.

I used angular to make a interactive photo sliders for all the galleries.

Overall this is still not entirely done. I am still updating things as the owner is
working with me designing graphics to integrate into the layout. 
If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.
Thanks for your time. :)
