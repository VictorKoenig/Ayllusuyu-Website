# Ayllusuyu-Website


I wanted to create this outline for the project 
i have been working on and to illustrate the work and explain my progress.


This is a website i have been working on for quite some time, long before attending code louisville.
I picked this as a project because i have been working with Ayllusuyu on events, workshops, and web work for a long time.
It is still not entirely done, everything is dependant upon the owners approval. 


I used jquery and bootstrap for a responsive image map that resizes with interactive menu for the index page.
There is also a jquery image slider throughout the pages. 

I wanted to find and api that is relavent to the website rather than a distraction so 
I used a mailto api for a donations page for the Peru childrens fund. There is also a google analytics api.

I used angular to make a interactive photo sliders for all the galleries.

Overall the website is still not entirely done. 
I am still ironing out a few kinks in the overall responsiveness, orginazation, and updating things as the owner is
 working with me designing graphics to integrate into the layout. Thanks for your time. I appreciate it :)
