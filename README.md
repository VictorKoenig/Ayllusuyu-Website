# Ayllusuyu-Website


I wanted to create this outline for the project i have been working on to illustrate the work and explain my progress.

This is a website i have been working on for quite some time, long before attending code louisville.
I picked this project because i have been working with Ayllusuyu on events and workshops for a long time.
It is still not entirely done, because it is such a big site and everything is dependant upon the owners instruction.  
The owner is still working with me designing new graphics to integrate.


I used jquery and bootstrap for a responsive image map with interactive menu for the main page.
There is also a jquery image slider. 

I wanted to find and api that is relavent to the website rather than a distraction so 
I used a mailto api for a donations page for the Peru childrens fund

I used angular to make a interactive photos slider for all the galleries.

It is still not entirely done. I am still ironing out a few kinks and updating things. 
Thanks for your time. I appreciate it :)
