    <h2>Peru Healing Journey: The Amazon, Cuzco, The Sacred Valley, Machu Picchu</h2>
    <h3>September 21 to October 5, 2013</h3>

    <div class="callout-page">
    <i>Pictured Above</i><br />Machu Picchu - The Mountains are the Heart of Pachamama & The Amazon is the Blood that flows through the Heart
    </div>

    <p>In the jungle, the trees are so large that five men standing fingertip to fingertip barely encircle their trunks. Flowers every color of the rainbow and large enough to fill both hands with one blossom grow abundantly. Butterflies, five inches in width, fly freely through the foliage. Monkeys jump from branch to branch. At night, we can hear the call of the jaguar.</p>

    <p>Our journey takes us deep in the heart of the <strong>Amazon</strong>, where we stay in beautiful lodgings set within the rain forest.</p>


    <p>The Inca have never left <strong>Machu Picchu</strong>, this place of ancient knowledge. We come to know this, as we feel their presence in the ancient temples, working with us in sacred ceremony. Machu Picchu, with his sister mountain, Wanay Picchu, with gentle strength, reach into our hearts remembering, restoring, renewing our very beings with the conscious knowledge of who we really are. </p>

    <p>Not all the people who come with us to Peru or the workshops we offer are there for healing.  A person may feel that he/she has healed enough to move on to the next level.  It may be that, through the sacred ceremonies and work that person does, that person may find a wisp, unseen, unknown, unspoken, buried deep within himself or herself.  By bringing that wisp up into The Light, that person discovers healing has happened.  Often then, a person will say, "I didn't consciously know that was there.  I didn't know that vague feeling underneath everything else was the very thing that had to be healed so I could go to the next level."  That is why we know that healing happens through The Teachings brought into everyday life through sacred ceremony.  It could be something as simple as a change of thought, a choice to engage Life in a different way, paying more attention to that gut ping that has no thought or even logical sense to it.</p>
